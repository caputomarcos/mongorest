**Easy [REST][rest] [APIs][api] using [MongoDB][mongodb].**


# Overview

[MongoRest][mongorest] is a [Framework][framework] written in [Python][python] built on top of [PyMongo][pymongo] and [Werkzeug][werkzeug] to ease the creation of [REST][rest] [APIs][api] using [MongoDB][mongodb].


# Python Compatibility

* Python >= 2.7
* Python3 >= 3.3
* Pypy >= 2.6
* Pypy3 >= 2.4


# Mongo Compatibility

* MongoDB >= 2.4


# Requirements

* Cerberus >= 0.9.0
* PyMongo >= 3.0.0
* Six >= 1.10.0
* Werkzeug >= 0.10.0


# Installation

    pip install mongorest
    
    
# Usage

To define the settings for your project you should set the environment variable `MONGOREST_SETTINGS_MODULE` to the module where the settings are stored:

```python
from os import environ
environ['MONGOREST_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'project.settings'
```

To connect to your database you should specify the `MONGODB` setting on your mongorest settings module.
You can set the connection `URI`, or use other options like setting the `HOSTS` and `PORTS` of your replica-set.
If you are not using a replica-set you can just set the one `HOST` and `PORT`.

```python
MONGODB = {
    'URI': '',
    'USERNAME': '',
    'PASSWORD': '',
    'HOSTS': ['localhost'],
    'PORTS': [27017],
    'DATABASE': 'mongorest-test',
    'OPTIONS': [],
}
```

Here is a basic example of how easy it is to create an example library API with **MongoRest**:

```python
from mongorest.collection import Collection

class Book(Collection):
    schema = {
        'name': {'type': 'string', 'required': True},
        'genre': {'type': 'string', 'required': True},
        'author': {'type': 'string', 'required': True},
        'number_of_pages': {'type': 'integer'},
        'release_date': {'type': 'datetime'},
    }
```

First we created our Book collection that inherited from the `mongorest.Collection` class, then ee added a `schema` to specify the fields, and their types.
For more details on schema creation visit the documentation for **Cerberus** in this [LINK][cerberus].

```python
from mongorest.resource import ListResourceMixin, CreateResourceMixin

class BookResource(ListResourceMixin, CreateResourceMixin):
    collection = Book
    endpoint = 'books'
```

Here, by inheriting from these mongorest-builtin Mixins, our resource already has the list and create actions.
We also defined what will be the collection and endpoint this Resource refers to.

```python        
from mongorest.wsgi import WSGIDispatcher
from werkzeug.serving import run_simple

if __name__ == '__main__':
    wsgi_app = WSGIDispatcher([BookResource])
    run_simple('localhost', 8000, wsgi_app)
```

Now we just had to instantiate the application as a `WSGIDispatcher` passing it our list of resources.
After that, we started our server and the API is ready to be consumed.
