# MongoRest

[![pypi-version]][pypi]

**Easy [REST][rest] [APIs][api] using [MongoDB][mongodb].**

# Overview

[MongoRest][mongorest] is a [Framework][framework] written in [Python][python] built on top of [PyMongo][pymongo] and [Werkzeug][werkzeug] to ease the creation of [REST][rest] [APIs][api] using [MongoDB][mongodb].


# Requirements

* Python >= 3.4.0
* MongoDB >= 3.0
* PyMongo >= 3.0
* Werkzeug >= 0.10.0

# Installation

    pip install mongorest
    
# Usage

This is a basic example where we are creating a simple API for a library, where we can list all our books, add new books and retrieve a single book:

    from mongorest.collection import Collection
    from mongorest.resource import (
        ListResourceMixin,
        CreateResourceMixin,
        RetrieveResourceMixin,
    )
    from mongorest.wsgi import WSGIDispatcher
    from werkzeug.serving import run_simple


    # Our Base Collection
    class Book(Collection):
        meta = {
            'required': {
               'name': str,
               'author': str,
               'genre': str
            }
            'optional': {
               'number_of_pages': int,
               'date_of_release': datetime,
            }
        }
        
    
    # Our API
    class BookResource(ListResourceMixin, CreateResourceMixin, RetrieveResourceMixin):
        collection = Book
        endpoint = 'books'
        
    
    # Creating the app and Running the Server
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app = WSGIDispatcher([BookResource])
        run_simple('localhost', 8000, app)
    
All we did was: Created a collection to represent our books, the collection has a `meta` specifying the required fields and the optional ones.
Also we created a Resource inheriting from the Resource Mixins. All we had to do for the Resource was chose the collection that will be used and what will be the endpoint.
After that we are just creating the app, passing it our list of resources and running the server.

`MongoRest` also includes builtin Delete and Update mixins that were not used in this example.


Let's show a more complex example where we create a customized Resource with a nested route:

    from mongorest.collection import Collection
    from mongorest.resource import Resource
    from mongorest.utils import deserialize
    from werkzeug.wrappers import Response
    
    class School(Collection):
        meta = {
            'required': {
               'name': str,
            }
            'optional': {
               'principal': str,
            }
        }
        
        
    class Student(Collection):
        meta = {
            'required': {
               'name': str,
               'age': int,
               'school': ObjectId,
               'grade': int,
            }
        }
    
    class SchoolResource(Resource):
        collection = School
        endpoint = 'schools'
        
        urls = [Rule('/<_id>/students/<grade>/', methods=['GET'], endpoint='grade_students')]
        
        def grade_students(request, _id, grade):
            school = self.collection.find_one({'_id': deserialize(_id)})
            
            if school:
                return Response(
                    Students.find({
                        'school': school['_id'],
                        'grade': deserialize(grade),
                    }),
                    content_type='application/json',
                    status=200
                )
            else:
                return Response(
                    {'error': 'School does not exist.'},
                    status=400
                )
        
In this example, we created a nested route on our customized Resource. All we had to do was inherit from resource, chose the collection and the endpoint and add an URL for our view.
And with `MongoRest` you can easily do much more.
