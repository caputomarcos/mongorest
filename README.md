# MongoRest

[![pypi-version]][pypi]

**Easy [REST][rest] [APIs][api] using [MongoDB][mongodb].**


# Overview

[MongoRest][mongorest] is a [Framework][framework] written in [Python][python] built on top of [PyMongo][pymongo] and [Werkzeug][werkzeug] to ease the creation of [REST][rest] [APIs][api] using [MongoDB][mongodb].


# Requirements

* Python >= 3.4.0
* MongoDB >= 3.0
* PyMongo >= 3.0
* Werkzeug >= 0.10.0


# Installation

    pip install mongorest
    
    
# Usage

Here is a basic example of how easy it is to create an API with **MongoRest**:


    from mongorest.collection import Collection

    class Book(Collection):
        meta = {
            'required': {
               'name': str, 'author': str, 'genre': str
            }
            'optional': {
               'number_of_pages': int, 'date_of_release': datetime,
            }
        }

First we created our Book collection, that inherited from the `Collection` class. <br />
We added a `meta` to specify the required and optional fields, and their types. <br />


    from mongorest.resource import (
        ListResourceMixin, CreateResourceMixin, RetrieveResourceMixin,
    )


    class BookResource(ListResourceMixin, CreateResourceMixin, RetrieveResourceMixin):
        collection = Book
        endpoint = 'books'
        
Here, by inheriting from these Mixins our Resource already has the list, create and retrieve actions. <br />
We also defined what will be the collection and endpoint this Resource refers to. <br />

        
    from mongorest.wsgi import WSGIDispatcher
    from werkzeug.serving import run_simple


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app = WSGIDispatcher([BookResource])
        run_simple('localhost', 8000, app)
    
Now we just had to instantiate the app as a `WSGIDispatcher` passing it our list of resources. <br />
Then we started our server and the API is ready. <br />


Now lets go for an example that is a little bit more complex:

    from mongorest.collection import Collection
    
    
    class School(Collection):
        meta = {
            'required': {'name': str}
            'optional': {'principal': str}
        }
        
 
    class Student(Collection):
        meta = {
            'required': {
               'name': str, 'age': int, 'school': ObjectId, 'grade': int,
            }
        }
        
Again, here we are simply defining our collections. <br />


    from mongorest.resource import Resource
    from mongorest.utils import deserialize, serialize
    from werkzeug.wrappers import Response
    
    class SchoolResource(Resource):
        collection = School
        endpoint = 'schools'
        
        urls = [Rule('/<_id>/students/<grade>/', methods=['GET'], endpoint='grade_students')]
        
        def grade_students(request, _id, grade):
            school = self.collection.find_one({'_id': deserialize(_id)})
            
            if school:
                return Response(
                    Students.find(
                        {'school': school['_id'], 'grade': deserialize(grade)}
                        serialized=True
                    ),
                    content_type='application/json',
                    status=200
                )
            else:
                return Response(
                    serialize({'error': 'School does not exist.'}),
                    status=400
                )
                
Now we have created a custom Resource, inheriting from the `Resource` class. <br />
Again we defined the collection and the endpoint for the resource, but we also defined the urls for the views we created. Only one in this case. <br />
Then comes the view itself, that is a view with a nested route that returns all students who go to that school from a given grade.
